# NaiveBayes_LogisticRegression
Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for classifying spam and ham emails.
The dataset used for training the model labels good emails as ham and the other ones as spam.
For developing the Naive Bayes model we have used the Bag of Words model
For developing the Logistic Regression model we have used the Bernoulli model.
